This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.\n  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4f55\u5148\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc6\u522bLLM\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u6559\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u5f53\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u770b\u5230LLM\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c31\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u6559\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "1. \u9996\u5148\u68c0\u9a8c\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6309\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7ec4\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u5404\u7ec4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u4e14LLM\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u7ec4\uff1b2. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5df2\u77e5\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6240\u5b66\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u4f55\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "1. \u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u6559\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\uff1b2. \u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b3. \u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u7528\u6237\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u663e\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u5219\u672a\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6559\u5b66\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u5bf9LLM\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\uff1a1. \u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5931\u8d25\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.", "AI": {"tldr": "COMETH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u7cca\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u53d1\u751f\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b300\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d66\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cMiniLM\u5d4c\u5165+K-means\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3) \u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b4) \u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u4e8c\u5143\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "COMETH\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a60%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aefLLM\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u7ea630%\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u4e00\u500d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "COMETH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLLM\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e5\u672c\u521b\u610f\u56de\u5e94\u6e38\u620fOogiri\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Oogiri-Master\u57fa\u51c6\u548cOogiri-Corpus\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7d\u9ed8\u662f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u4eba\u521b\u9020\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f7f\u56de\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6765\u8bf4\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u5019\u9009\u56de\u5e94\u5c11\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u65f6\u66b4\u9732\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u53ef\u6bd4\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Oogiri-Master\u57fa\u51c6\u548cOogiri-Corpus\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u914d\u5bf9\u7ea6100\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5019\u9009\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u7531\u7ea6100\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u59d4\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u6587\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d1e\u5bdf\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5e7d\u9ed8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite its importance, memory management is still largely driven by hand-designed heuristics, offering little insight into the long-term and uncertain consequences of memory decisions. In practice, choices about what to read or write shape future retrieval and downstream behavior in ways that are difficult to anticipate. We argue that memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the utility of memory is delayed and dependent on future interactions. To this end, we propose DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. Within this architecture, candidate operations are evaluated via value functions and uncertainty estimators, enabling an aggregate policy to arbitrate decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk. Our contribution is not a new algorithm, but a principled reframing that clarifies the limitations of heuristic approaches and provides a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u5916\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u957f\u671f\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u7528\u548c\u672a\u6765\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5373\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5b58\u50a8\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u5236\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u672a\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0cDAM\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u671f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.\n  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.\n  Keywords: House-Tree-Person test; multimodal large language model; multi-agent collaboration; cosine similarity; computational psychology; artificial intelligence", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316HTP\u7ed8\u753b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "HTP\u7ed8\u753b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6295\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u9762\u4e34\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5f02\u8d28\u5316\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u68c0\u67e5\u8005\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u91cf\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u53bb\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a0.75\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u7ea60.05\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.85\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u7406\u89e3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u6295\u5c04\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002"}}

We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book \"Life and Death Dictionary\" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players.

Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset.

Benchmarking the Intelligence and Defectiveness of LLM Hallucinations", "comment": "Published as a conference paper at KDD 2026", "summary": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "HIC-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u5206\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5e7b\u89c9(IH)\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u5e7b\u89c9(DH)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u77e9\u9635\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6216\u6709\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHIC-Bench\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u7ed3\u6784\u5316IH/DH\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u5408\u6258\u5170\u65af\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u6807(\u539f\u521b\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u4ef7\u503c)\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6(\u79d1\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u504f\u5dee)\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u77e9\u9635\uff1b2) \u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5341\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u521b\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3) \u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u793a(DHP)\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u8bc4\u59d4\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1IH/DH\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aIH\u548cDH\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002IH\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HIC-Bench\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdbLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u521b\u9020\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u9700\u8981\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively.

Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08GoT\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u6d41\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u8a00\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7531\u9690\u542b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5b9a\u65f6\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08GoT\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u65b9\u6848\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5c42\u4ea4\u6d41\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u8a00\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8a00\u8bed\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u53e3\u8bed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GoT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1.

Ratliff", "Banghua Zhu"], "title": "dUltra: Ultra-Fast Diffusion Language Models via Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \\texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "dUltra\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6bcf\u4e2a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u7801\u4e0d\u52305\u4e2atoken\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fadUltra\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u89c4\u5212\u5934\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563LLM\u548c\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cdUltra\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u671d\u7740\u5b9e\u73b0\"\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u52bf\"\uff08\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "dUltra\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance.

This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning.

A Causal and Adversarial Analysis of Chain-of-Continuous-Thought", "comment": "13 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "COCONUT\uff08\u94fe\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u867d\u7136\u58f0\u79f0\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u662f\u4f2a\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790COCONUT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u8bb0\u5b50\u96c6\uff08COCONUT\u548c\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6377\u5f84\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MMLU\u548cHotpotQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "COCONUT\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u7406\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCOCONUT\u6301\u7eed\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f2a\u5f71\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ea\u662f\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5bf9\u6377\u5f84\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "COCONUT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f2a\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u63a9\u76d6\u5bf9\u6377\u5f84\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4f46\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6377\u5f84\u4f7f\u7528\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning.

Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SARIMA\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08LSTM\u3001Seq2Seq\u3001Transformer\uff09\u5728\u836f\u7269\u8fc7\u91cf\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LSTM\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u836f\u7269\u8fc7\u91cf\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u57282023\u5e74\u8d85\u8fc78\u4e07\u4eba\uff0cCOVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SARIMA\u5047\u8bbe\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e2d\u65ad\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7f8e\u56fdCDC\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\uff082015-2019\u5e74\u8bad\u7ec3/\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c2020-2023\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83SARIMA\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08LSTM\u3001Seq2Seq\u3001Transformer\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u548c60\u591a\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "LSTM\u5728\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08MAPE 17.08% vs SARIMA 23.88%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u597d\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u738768.8% vs 47.9%\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08Seq2Seq\u3001Transformer\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u5747\u503c\u800c\u975e\u6355\u6349\u65b0\u5174\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6821\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a15\u4e2a\u5dde\u536b\u751f\u90e8\u95e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "CATCH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u9898\u8868\u793a\u3001\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u9898\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728DSTC-12\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u9898\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4e3b\u9898\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCATCH\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u9898\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5468\u56f4\u4e3b\u9898\u7247\u6bb5\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bdd\u8bed\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\uff1b3) \u5206\u5c42\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u9c81\u68d2\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5ba2\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6\uff08DSTC-12\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCATCH\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e868B\u53c2\u6570\u7684LLM\u3002", "conclusion": "CATCH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u9898\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ara-HOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u65b9\u8a00\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u8a00\u7279\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u65b9\u8a00\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u8a00\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ara-HOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e94\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2aMT\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684Jais\u3001\u901a\u7528GPT-3.5\u548c\u57fa\u7ebfNLLB-200\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Ara-HOPE\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65b9\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u4ecd\u7136\u662fDA-MSA\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u6700\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002Jais\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Ara-HOPE\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u65b9\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u7684MT\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors.

Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization.

In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training.

Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $\u03a9( \u03b1_1 \u03c3\\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $\u03a9(\u03b1_1 \u03c3^2 \\frac{M}\u0394 \\ln T)$ are proved, where $\u03b1_1$ is the largest priority weight and $\u03c3$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \\texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \\texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \\sqrt{K \\ln KT }$ and $\u03b1_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u81c2\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bb9\u91cf\u5355\u4f4d\u5173\u8054\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5173\u8054\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u6309\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u81c2\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u5148\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSB-PRS-OffOpt\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(MK\u00b3)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MSB-PRS-OffOpt\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f8b\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9057\u61be\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u03a9(\u03b1\u2081\u03c3\u221a(KMT))\u548c\u03a9(\u03b1\u2081\u03c3\u00b2(M/\u0394)lnT)\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9057\u61be\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u76f8\u5dee\u221a(KlnKT)\u548c\u03b1\u2081K\u00b2\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7531\u7279\u6b8a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "TreeEIC\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u6811\u7684IMVC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\uff08IMVC\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709IMVC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4f46\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u914d\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5b9a\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u5185\u6267\u884c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u96c6\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7c07\u95f4\u5224\u522b\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u4fc3\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTreeEIC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684IMVC\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeEIC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u914d\u5bf9\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMe\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u6cd5\u88c5\u9970\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u88c5\u9970(DeMe)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u88c5\u9970\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u88c5\u9970\u3001\u540e\u88c5\u9970\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d2\u5165\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u88c5\u9970\u6280\u672f\u4f7fIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u6545\u969c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMe\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u88c5\u9970\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86IoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines.

Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f55\u89c1\u914d\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7f55\u89c1\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u56fe\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u56fe\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u5c45\u751f\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u52a0\u5f3a\u6216\u51cf\u5f31\u914d\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u914d\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation.

This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol.

However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes.

However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget.

This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quicker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u8350\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f320-40\u5206\u949f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7d27\u8feb\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684Quicker\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u95ee\u9898\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u6587\u732e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Q2CRBench-3\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Quicker\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1a\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6587\u732e\u7b5b\u9009\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u9762\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6bd4\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u5355\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u4e0eQuicker\u534f\u4f5c\u53ef\u5c06\u63a8\u8350\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f320-40\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "Quicker\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5faa\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios.

Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a \"Gold Standard\" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench.

Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets.

However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks.

However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001FFN\u548cMoE\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8349\u6848token\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u4e2a\u8349\u6848token\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u5e38\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u548cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6token-by-token\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001FFN\u548cMoE\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8349\u6848token\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6458\u8981\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits \"martial\" into \"mart\" and \"ial\").

Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties. These models offer valuable tools for optimizing concrete mix design and enhancing structural performance evaluation in engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08ET-XGB\u3001RF-LGBM\u3001Transformer-XGB\uff09\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u94a2-\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u7ea4\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dET-XGB\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cRF-LGBM\u5bf9\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cSHAP\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u94a2-\u805a\u4e19\u70ef\u7ea4\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u914d\u5408\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1aExtra Trees\u4e0eXGBoost\u7ec4\u5408\uff08ET-XGB\uff09\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u4e0eLightGBM\u7ec4\u5408\uff08RF-LGBM\uff09\u3001Transformer\u4e0eXGBoost\u7ec4\u5408\uff08Transformer-XGB\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7k\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3001SHAP\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ET-XGB\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5R\u00b2\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\uff1a\u6297\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea60.994\u3001\u6297\u5f2f\u5f3a\u5ea60.944\u3001\u6297\u62c9\u5f3a\u5ea60.978\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9CS\u548cTS\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u4f4e\uff08\u7ea613-16%\u548c30.4%\uff09\u3002RF-LGBM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9FS\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\uff08R\u00b2 0.977\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u4f4e\uff08\u7ea65-33%\uff09\u3002Transformer-XGB\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002SHAP\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7ea4\u7ef4\u957f\u5f84\u6bd4\u3001\u7845\u7070\u548c\u94a2\u7ea4\u7ef4\u542b\u91cf\u662f\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u914d\u5408\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, most existing agents rely on append-only context maintenance or passively triggered compression heuristics, which often lead to context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions. We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories.

Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow.

However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%.

To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \\(\\pm\\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a761\u4f4dLLM\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d1f\u62c5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c1\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u67091\u4f4dPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u57281\u4f4dLLM\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf91\u4f4dLLM\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76841\u4f4dPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u67901\u4f4dLLM\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u5339\u914d\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67091\u4f4dPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller \"compressor\" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger \"predictor\" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\\times$ more accurate, $4.6\\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\\%$ of API costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4e0d\u4ec5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u66f4token\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684API\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\"\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\"\u548c\"Claude Code\"\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u914d\u5bf9\u626b\u63cf\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\uff1b2\uff09\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4e0d\u4ec5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u66f4token\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4f20\u9012\u66f4\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6bd4\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u672c\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u4e91\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u914d\u5bf9\uff1b4\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec53B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u672c\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5c31\u80fd\u6062\u590d99%\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e74%\u7684API\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u6807\u3002\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.\n  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $\u0398(\\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$.

Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches.

The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \\texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5728LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5404\u79cdKL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cKL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76RL\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2.5-7B\u3001Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u3001Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff1a(1) \u68af\u5ea6\u6709\u504f\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b(2) \u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f02\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9RL\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.\n  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis).

While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE.

Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$\u03b2$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro.

Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data.

Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408CMAB-T\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408CUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08CMAB-T\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6162\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f25\u8865\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408CMAB-T\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408CUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u52a0\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u6df7\u5408CUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u7eaf\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408CMAB-T\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6df7\u5408CUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective.

However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.
